- Which regions are the most and least profitable?
- Which product categories drive or drain profit?

## Tools & Skills

- Data visualization
- Business insight generation

## Dataset
- Source: Global Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)
- Tables used: Orders, Returns

## Key Metrics

## Key Insights
- Several high-volume products operate at a negative profit margin due to heavy discounting.
